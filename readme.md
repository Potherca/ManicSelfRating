Although I (luckily) do no suffer from mania or depression I've found it useful 
to keep track of my mood in more stressed or hectic periods. Instead of having 
to print a form out and fill it in by hand, I created a digital version.

I have the intention to add persistance through any of the freely available 
CouchDB hosts to be able to keep track of movements over a longer period of time.

I would eventually also like to add the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and ask 
for the user's age to determine which scale to display.
