I've found it useful to keep track of my mood in more stressed or hectic 
periods. Instead of having to print a form out and fill it in by hand, I 
have created [a digital version of the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale](https://blog.pother.ca/ManicSelfRating/Altman-Self-Rating-Mania-Scale.html).

I would eventually like to add the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and ask 
for the user's age to determine which scale to display.

Eventually a persistance could be added, either server side or in the client 
(using localStorage) to keep track of movements over a longer period of time.
