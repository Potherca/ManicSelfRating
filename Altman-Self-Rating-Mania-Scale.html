<h2>Overview <span class="JS_toggle" rel="#overview">Click to Show/Hide</span></h2>
<div id="overview">
	<ul>
		<li>The ASRM is a 5-item self rating mania scale, designed to assess the presence and/or severity of manic symptoms.
		<li>The ASRM may be used in an inpatient or outpatient setting to screen for the presence of and/or severity of manic symptoms for clinical or research purposes.
		<li>Because it is compatible with DSM-IV criteria, and correlates significantly with Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), it can be used effectively as a screening instrument to facilitate diagnostic assessment inpatients with hypomanic symptoms.
	</ul>

	<h3>Clinical Utility</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>In outpatient settings the ASRM may be used as a psycho-educational tool to help patients recognize and monitor their own symptoms.
		<li>It may be used reliably as a self-report measure of efficacy for patients receiving clinical treatment.
		<li>It may be used in combination with self-rating depression scales to assess mixed states of mania and depression.
	</ul>

	<h3>Scoring</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Sum items 1-5
			<ul>
				<li>A cutoff score of 6 or higher indicates a high probability of a manic or hypomanic condition (based on a sensitivity rating of 85.5% and a specificity rating of 87.3%).
				<li>A score of 6 or higher may indicate a need for treatment and/or further diagnostic workup to confirm a diagnosis of mania or hypomania.
				<li>A score of 5 or lower is less likely to be associated with significant symptoms of mania.
			</ul>
		</li>			
		<li>As a self-report measure of clinical efficacy, items 1-5 should be summed to give a total score, which then may be compared to subsequent total scores during and after treatment.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Psychometric Properties</h3>
	<p>
		Specificity of 85.5<br/>
		Sensitivity of 87.31<sup><a href="#footnote_1" id="remark_1">1</a></sup>
